# automated-snake
## motivation
This project is meant for everyone who really sucks at gaming. As the name suggests, it is a snake ripoff that has builtin autopilot functionality to make you look cool in front of your friends. (Although I don't think the cool kids still play snake, do they?)
## reuirements
As this project is made for the original Nintendo Wii, you neew one of those. Nintendo wasn't a big fan of unsigned software on their systems though, which let's us to the third system requirement: [homebrew](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Main_Page) installed on your Wii. To install that and to run any software, you will additionally need an SD-Card (capacity doesnt really matter). So in conclusion, you will need the following:
1. A Nintendo Wii with Homebrew installed
2. An SD-Card and a way to put data onto it
## "installation"
To run this game, you will need to simply create a folder named "automated-snake" inside the "apps" folder on you SD-Card. You then need to copy both the "automated-snake.elf" file and the "meta.xml" file to than folder. After that you should probably rename the "automated-snake.elf" to "boot.elf".
*Simple as that, you are done!*
